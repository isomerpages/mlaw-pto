CPF Money
---

**1.	How do I know if my loved one has any CPF money and if they had made a valid nomination?**<br> 
The money from the Central Provident Fund (CPF) of a person who has died will be distributed in line with the nomination they made during their lifetime.

You will need to check with the CPF Board whether the person who has died had made a valid nomination for their CPF money. If they had, the CPF Board will pay the money direct to the person or people they nominated (if those people are older than 18).

If the person who has died did not make a valid nomination, the CPF Board will send their CPF money to us, as required by law.

The CPF Board will also send us the CPF money of a person who has died if the person chosen to receive that money is under 18 years old (unless she is a widow).<br>

**2.	What do I need to do for the CPF money to be distributed to me?**<br>
You will need to make an online application "Administration of CPF / Baby Bonus / Edusave / PSEA Monies" at  [https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/pto/welcome.xhtml](https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/pto/welcome.xhtml) so that we can deal with the money.

You will need to have your Singpass ready in order to access our online application form. You may apply for your Singpass at [https://www.singpass.gov.sg](https://www.singpass.gov.sg) if you do not have one.

**6.	How would the Public Trustee distribute the CPF money of a non-Muslim?**<br>
If the person who died was not a Muslim, we will distribute the CPF money in line with the Intestate Succession Act. The Act states that the movable property (for example, money in a bank account) will be distributed according to the law of the country in which the person was domiciled at the time of his death. 

If the person who died was domiciled in Singapore at the time of their death, we will distribute the CPF money in line with the rules of distribution in the Intestate Succession Act.


(Note: The place of domicile refers to the place where the Deceased intended his permanent home to be. It does not refer to his nationality or residence.)<br>

**7.	What are the Rules of Distribution under the Intestate Succession Act (Cap. 146)?**<br>
Kindly note that these Rules of Distribution apply only to a non-Muslim Deceased domiciled in Singapore.

Nominated CPF Money
---

**1. The deceased had nominated his CPF money to a person (i.e. nominee) who has passed on. What should I do?**<br>
If CPF money was nominated in favour of a person ( “the nominee”) who has passed on, the money will form part of the estate of the nominee, if the nominee had passed on after the CPF member. If you are a next-of-kin of the nominee, you may apply to the Public Trustee to administer the estate of the deceased nominee if it is a small-value estate.

If the deceased nominee’s estate does not qualify for administration by the Public Trustee, you will need to apply to court for Letters of Administration or Grant of Probate to deal with the nominee’s estate, including the CPF money payable to the nominee. If you qualify for legal aid, you may apply to the Legal Aid Bureau for help in getting Letters of Administration. If you do not qualify for legal aid, you will need to hire a lawyer. Where the Public Trustee does not act for the deceased nominee’s estate, the CPF money payable to the nominee will be paid to the administrator of their estate or the executor of their will.

Please refer to our online FAQ under <a href = "https://pto.mlaw.gov.sg/deceased-cpf-estate-monies/information-for-next-of-kin-estate-monies/" target = "_blank">Estate (Other Assets)</a> on the situations where the Public Trustee would be able to assist to administer an estate, and on how to make an online application to the Public Trustee for the administration of a deceased estate.<br>

**2. What fees do you charge for holding nominated CPF money in trust for a minor?**<br>
The fees we charge for holding nominated CPF money in trust for a minor are shown below.

<table>
  <tr>
   <th>Amount of CPF Money</th>
   <th>Charge</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the first $1,000</td>
    <td>2.400%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the next $9,000</td>
    <td>1.500%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the next $240,000</td>
    <td>0.750%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the next $250,000</td>
    <td>0.450%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For amounts over $500,000</td>
    <td>0.300%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

These are one-time fees, which we will take from the nominated CPF money. They include GST and cannot be waived.

The money held in trust for the minor is invested by the Public Trustee according to law. The investment earns interest for the minor from year to year. Whenever interest is to be paid to the minor, a fee is charged on the amount of the interest. The net interest amount (less the fee) is paid into the minor’s trust fund. The fee charged on the interest amount is as shown below.

<table>
  <tr>
   <th>Amount of Interest Earned</th>
   <th>Charge</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the first $1,000</td>
    <td>5.50%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the next $1,000</td>
    <td>4.50%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the next $1,000</td>
    <td>3.50%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For amounts in excess of $3,000</td>
    <td>2.25%</td>
  </tr>

Online Submission of Application
---

**1. I need someone to assist me to submit the online application but I do not want to engage the e-Helper’s service**<br>
You may wish to get a family member or a trusted friend to assist you in completing our online application form.

**2. We have notified CPF Board of the Deceased’s death last week and were told that the Deceased’s un-nominated CPF money will be forwarded to the Public Trustee for administration. We tried to submit an online application for the Public Trustee to administer the Deceased’s un-nominated CPF money. However, your system showed that there was no un-nominated CPF money for administration. What is going on?**<br>
Upon receiving notification of the death of the CPF member, the CPF Board typically requires **4 to 6 weeks** to remit the un-nominated CPF money to us for administration.  

You will only be able to submit an online application for the administration of the Deceased’s un-nominated CPF money after we have received the money from the CPF Board.

Once we have received the money from the CPF Board, we will write to the person who had notified the CPF Board of the death of the CPF member, to make an online application to us for the administration of the Deceased’s un-nominated CPF money.

**With effect from 5 Mar 2018, all payments will be made electronically.**
