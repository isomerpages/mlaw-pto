**1.	What is bona vacantia?**<br>
Bona vacantia literally translates as "ownerless goods". It refers to the assets in the estates of people who have died without leaving a will and without any surviving entitled next-of-kin[1]. Anyone can make an equitable or moral claim on the bona vacantia estate of the deceased as long as he is able to produce the necessary documents and evidence required to support his claim.

[1] The entitled next-of-kin are the deceased's spouse, children, parents, siblings, grandparents, uncles and aunts. 

**2.	What is an equitable or moral claim on a bona vacantia estate?**<br>
In assessing whether there is an “equitable or moral claim” within the meaning of section 27 (3) of the Civil Law Act, the Public Trustee will consider the following factors:

(a) The length and nature of the relationship between the deceased and the claimant;

(b) Any legal or moral obligations which the deceased had towards the claimant;

(c) The way in which the claimant behaved towards the deceased including the contribution (if any) made by the claimant to the welfare of the deceased;

(d) The deceased’s last wishes

The above are meant as general guidelines only. All claims are assessed on a case-by-case basis and on their respective individual merits as supported by evidence. A claimant may not necessarily succeed in his claim even if one or more of the above factors are present.

**3.	Who can make an equitable or moral claim on the bona vacantia estate of the deceased?**<br>
Anyone (including charities and other bodies) can make an equitable or moral claim on the estate of the deceased as long as he is able to produce the necessary documents and evidence required to support his claim. However, before a claim can be considered by the Public Trustee, the claimant must prove that the deceased has no surviving next-of-kin who is eligible to inherit the deceased’s property and/or monies under the Intestate Succession Act (Cap. 146). 

**4.	Can I make an equitable or moral claim on the bona vacantia estate if the deceased has entitled next-of-kin but they do not wish to deal with nor claim the estate?**<br>
No, you will not be able to make an equitable or moral claim against the estate because the deceased is survived by next-of-kin entitled to a share in the estate and the estate will not be considered bona vacantia.

**5.	I am not related to the deceased but I did help the deceased in later years by running errands and generally looking after the deceased. Can I be reimbursed for this?**<br>
The Public Trustee will assess each claim on a case-by-case basis.  You may wish to submit your application for the Public Trustee’s assessment after meeting the eligibility conditions and adhering to the prescribed waiting period (see section on Time). 

**6.	Can I make an equitable or moral claim on a Muslim estate with no entitled next-of-kin?**<br>
No, section 27(6) of the Civil Law Act (Cap. 43) specifically excludes Muslim estates.

For Muslim estates without entitled next-of-kin, the monies will be paid to Baitulmal which is in accordance with Muslim inheritance laws.

**7.	What are the assets of the deceased against which I can make an equitable or moral claim?**<br>
You can make an equitable or moral claim against all the assets of the deceased (including un-nominated CPF monies) as long as you can show proof that the deceased has no surviving next-of-kin who is eligible to inherit these assets under the Intestate Succession Act (Cap. 146). Whether the claim will succeed against all or only part of the assets will depend on the facts and circumstances.

**8.	I do not know if the deceased has any assets. Can the Public Trustee assist me in my search?**<br>
The Public Trustee will not be able to assist a claimant in his search for assets of the deceased.  A claimant will need to provide the Public Trustee with the details of the assets owned by the deceased (including the estimated value(s)).

**9.	What happens if the actual size of the bona vacantia estate turns out to be larger than what I have declared?**<br>
If the value of the deceased’s estate eventually amount to more than what you have declared and exceeds $50,000, we may require additional documents and checks as stated in Q14 and Q15. To avoid unnecessary delays in the administration of your claim, please try to provide an accurate estimate of the value of the deceased’s estate.

**10.	Is there a time limit for making an equitable or moral claim on a bona vacantia estate?**<br>
No, there is no time limit for making a claim. 

**11.	When can I make an equitable or moral claim on a bona vacantia estate?**<br>
You can make a claim only after the expiry of the waiting period stated in the table below.
