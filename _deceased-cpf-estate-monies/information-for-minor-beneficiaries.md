2.		Can you release the money held-in-trust because I am now the only parent or guardian of the child and have financial difficulties supporting the child?

Under sections 68 and 70 of the Women’s Charter, it is the duty of the parent or guardian of a child to maintain or contribute to their maintenance if they cannot look after themselves.

If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child and you face financial difficulties in supporting the child, you may apply to us for a maintenance allowance out of the child’s money which we are holding.

In deciding the amount of the maintenance allowance, we will consider the following.

  * Your income, property and other financial resources.
  * Your financial needs and responsibilities.
  * The financial needs and the age of the child.
  * The way in which the child is being or is expected to be educated or trained.<br><br>

3.		How do I apply for a child’s maintenance allowance?

You will need to make an online application for maintenance allowance at www.mlaw.gov.sg/pto. Select "Application for Maintenance Allowance".

You will also need to have your Singpass ready to access our online application form. You may apply for your Singpass at https://www.singpass.gov.sg if you do not have one.


If you are not eligible for a Singpass, you may apply for a log-in ID and password through our website at http://www.mlaw.gov.sg/pto.
