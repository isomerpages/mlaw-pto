**2. Can you release the money held-in-trust because I am now the only parent or guardian of the child and have financial difficulties supporting the child?**<br>
Under sections 68 and 70 of the Women’s Charter, it is the duty of the parent or guardian of a child to maintain or contribute to their maintenance if they cannot look after themselves.

If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child and you face financial difficulties in supporting the child, you may apply to us for a maintenance allowance out of the child’s money which we are holding.

In deciding the amount of the maintenance allowance, we will consider the following.

  1) Your income, property and other financial resources.<br>
  2) Your financial needs and responsibilities.<br>
  3) The financial needs and the age of the child.<br>
  4) The way in which the child is being or is expected to be educated or trained.<br>

**3. How do I apply for a child’s maintenance allowance?**<br>
You will need to make an online application at [https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/pto/welcome.xhtml](https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/pto/welcome.xhtml). Select "Application for Maintenance Allowance".

You will also need to have your Singpass ready to access our online application form. You may apply for your Singpass at [https://www.singpass.gov.sg](https://www.singpass.gov.sg) if you do not have one.

If you are not eligible for a Singpass, you may apply for a log-in ID and password through our website at [https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/pto/welcome.xhtml](https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/pto/welcome.xhtml).<br>

**4. What are the documents that I need to send to you?**<br>
You will be required to provide proof that you are not able to support the child (for example, your monthly payslips) and documents relating to the child’s financial needs.

For us to make payment, you will also need to give us evidence of a joint savings account opened with the child. We will accept a copy of the bank statement with the joint bank account number with the account holders’ names on it.<br>

**5. How will the maintenance allowance be paid?**<br>
The maintenance allowance will be credited into a **joint savings account**, maintained by the parent or legal guardian with the child, via GIRO every three months in January, April, July and October.<br>

**6. Can I get a reimbursement of extra expenses which are more than the maintenance allowance?**<br>
We may reimburse you, out of the child’s money, for the expenses of the education and welfare of the child, if these are not covered by the maintenance allowance.

We consider each request on a **case-by-case basis**.<br>


**7. What do I need to do to get a reimbursement of extra expenses?**<br>
You will need to send documents to your case officer showing proof of payment.<br>

Common proof-of-payment documents are:

1) a letter of acceptance from the child’s school showing the amount of school fees; and<br>
2) receipts showing proof of payment to the school.<br>

**8. What happens if I cannot afford to pay the extra expenses?**<br>
If we agree to pay for the expenses out of your child’s money, we will make payment to the school direct.<br>

**9. What do you do with the money held-in-trust?**<br>
We will invest the money that is held in trust in safe financial instruments like fixed deposits and bonds. We will pay the money, plus interest earned (less our fees), to the child when they reach the age of majority (either 18 or 21).

You can view the Statement of Accounts online through our eService ([https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/pto/welcome.xhtml](https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/pto/welcome.xhtml)).<br>

**10.	What are the fees charged by the Public Trustee for the investment of money held-in-trust?**<br>
The statutory fees charged by the Public Trustee on the amount of interest earned for the investment of money held-in-trust are as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Amount of Interest Earned</th>
    <th>Charge</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the first $1,000</td>
    <td>5.50%</td>
  </tr>

    <td>For the next $1,000</td>
    <td>4.50%</td>
