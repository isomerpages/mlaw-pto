Information for Next-of-Kin (Estate Monies)
---

**1. What do I need to ensure before applying to the Public Trustee?**

You will need to ensure that the estate does not fall under one of the situations stated below where the Public Trustee cannot act.<br><br>

**2. What are the situations where the Public Trustee cannot act?**

We cannot act if:

* the estate is worth more than $50,000;
* a court application for Letters of Administration or Grant of Probate has been filed;
* there are conflicting claims to the estate or disputes among the beneficiaries;
* the estate has outstanding debts or liabilities;
* the person who has died had shares or other interest in unlisted companies (foreign or local);
* the person who has died was a partner, a sole proprietor or had an interest in a firm or other business;
* the person who died was the sole lessee (owner) of a HDB flat and a child is eligible to inherit the whole or part of the flat;
* there are pending lawsuits which involve the person who has died;
* there are insurance policies where one or more people have been nominated as beneficiaries [Under Section 73 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap. 61), Sections 49L and 49M of the Insurance Act (Cap. 142)];
* there are trust bank accounts opened with a child; and
* there are commercial vehicles involved such as taxis.

In these cases, you will need to apply to the court for Letters of Administration to deal with the person’s estate.

If you qualify for legal aid, you may apply to the Legal Aid Bureau for assistance in obtaining a Letter of Administration. More information on the Legal Aid Bureau can be accessed at www.lab.gov.sg. If you do not qualify for legal aid, you will need to engage the services of a lawyer.<br><br>

**3. What are the assets administered by the Public Trustee?**

The assets administered by the Public Trustee are:

* Deceased's money in banks or other financial institutions in Singapore;
* Deceased's shares which are listed on the Singapore Exchange;
* Deceased's fully paid-up vehicles, apart from commercial vehicles like taxis (we will only transfer the vehicles);
* salary the Deceased was owed but not yet paid;
* Deceased's items in a safe-deposit box;
* Deceased's money paid as government compensation; and
* Deceased's money from the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme.<br><br>

**4. How do I apply to the Public Trustee to administer a Deceased’s Estate?**

You will need to make an online application at www.mlaw.gov.sg/pto under eServices for the Public Trustee to administer the Deceased’s estate monies.  Please note that you will be required to disclose information on the Deceased’s shares, bank savings account, death gratuity, insurance policies and vehicles owned (if any) in the online application.

You will need to have your Singpass ready in order to access our online application form. You may apply for your Singpass at https://www.singpass.gov.sg if you do not have one.

If you are ineligible to apply for a Singpass, you may apply for a login ID and password through our website: www.mlaw.gov.sg/pto under eServices.<br><br>

**5. How would the Public Trustee distribute the estate of a non-Muslim?**

If the person who died was not a Muslim, we will distribute the estate in line with the Intestate Succession Act, which says that the distribution of any movable property (for example, money in the bank account) will be regulated by the law of the country in which the person was domiciled at the time of their death.

If the person who died was domiciled in Singapore at the time of their death, we will distribute their estate in line with the rules of distribution in the Intestate Succession Act.

(Note: The place of domicile refers to the place where the Deceased intended his permanent home to be. It does not refer to his nationality or residence.)<br><br>

**6. What are the Rules of Distribution under the Intestate Succession Act (Cap. 146)?**

Kindly note that these Rules of Distribution apply only to a non-Muslim Deceased domiciled in Singapore.

The Public Trustee does not assist in resealing in the Singapore Courts, Letters of Administration or Grants of Probate that were obtained overseas. You will have to engage a Singapore lawyer to do this.

At present, you can search by name, practice area, and the type of law practice. We are working on further enhancements to the search function.

On a case-by-case basis, the Public Trustee does administer a deceased’s share in a HDB flat if it is of small value. You will first have to submit an online application for the Public Trustee to administer the deceased’s estate so that we may consider your request.

Please refer to our Q2 on the situations where the Public Trustee would not be able to administer an estate.<br><br>

**14. I need someone to assist me to submit the online application but I do not want to engage the e-Helper’s service.**
