**5.	How would the Public Trustee distribute the Baby Bonus / Edusave / PSEA / CDA money of a non-Muslim?**<br>
If the person who died was not a Muslim, we will distribute the Baby Bonus / Edusave / PSEA / CDA money in line with the Intestate Succession Act. The Act states that the movable property (for example, money in a bank account) will be distributed according to the law of the country in which the person was domiciled at the time of his death. (When we refer to where the person was domiciled, we mean where they intended their permanent home to be. It does not refer to their nationality or address.)

If the person who died was domiciled in Singapore at the time of their death, we will distribute the Baby Bonus / Edusave / PSEA / CDA money in line with the rules of distribution in the Intestate Succession Act.

(Note: The place of domicile refers to the place where the Deceased intended his permanent home to be. It does not refer to his nationality or residence.)<br>

**6.	What are the Rules of Distribution under the Intestate Succession Act (Cap. 146)?**<br>
Kindly note that these Rules of Distribution apply only to a non-Muslim Deceased domiciled in Singapore.
