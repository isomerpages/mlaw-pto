Drawing up a Will
---

**1. Can I make a will on my own without seeking the assistance of a solicitor?**<br>
Yes, you can make a will on your own without seeking the assistance of a solicitor. However, please note that a will may be challenged or invalid if it had been drafted improperly or was ambiguous.

**2. How do I make a will on my own?**<br>
The Public Trustee does not provide legal advice on how a will should be made. Since you are unclear about how to make a will on your own, you may consider seeking legal advice from a lawyer.

LSRA has an integrated online search function which lists all registered law practices (foreign or local), Singapore solicitors, foreign lawyers, and regulated non-practitioners. At present, you can search by name, practice area, and the type of law practice. We are working on further enhancements to the search function.

Please note that the search results are based on information provided by law practices and lawyers. The Ministry of Law does not make any warranty or representation as to their accuracy, completeness or reliability. 

**3. I am in the midst of drafting my will and would like to include the Public Trustee’s Office as the executor of my will. Please advise if this is possible?**<br>
The Public Trustee does not accept any appointment to act as an executor of a will. You can appoint a family member, friend, an independent professional or a trust company to be the executor of your will.

**4. Where can I make a will at a minimum cost?**<br>
We are unable to advise you on where you can make a will at a minimum cost. You will have to perform your own checks with individual lawyers and law firms on their fees and charges.
